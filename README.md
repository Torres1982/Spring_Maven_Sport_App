### Assessment Description:
This is my first Spring/Hibernate assessment for learning purpose.
It's a Simple Football League System.
- Reading Custom Validation Errors from the .properties file.
- Validation Annotations updated.
- Constraint Validator added for Custom Annotation (footballer category - prefixes).
- Hibernate configuration file for JDBC dB settings added.
- Created a separate package for Db Operations and a new class for Footballer DB Operations.
- Reading all Footballers (session query) created/updated successfully.
- Set up the Tomcat context.xml file - disabled caching the .jsp files.

### Further Work:
- All .xml configuration files exchanged with pure Java files configuration.
- Fixed Spring Security Configuration files - (2019-09-17).
- Login and Logout settings updated and fixed - (2019-09).
- Hibernate properties, jdbc properties, and Connection Pool properties updated - read from the properties file now (instead of being hard-coded) - (2019-09).
